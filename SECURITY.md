## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the DHL Shipment Tracker, please report it as soon via the _discussions page_.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following details (if available):
- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Potential impact and severity.
- Any suggested fixes or workarounds.

I aim to acknowledge all reports within **3 business days**, and provide updates on investigation status every **7 days** until resolution or a mitigation plan is communicated.

If the vulnerability is accepted, it will be prioritised and patched in the next appropriate release. If it is declined (e.g., due to being a non-issue or out of scope), a clear explanation will be provided.

I appreciate responsible disclosure and will give credit to the reporter if requested and appropriate.
